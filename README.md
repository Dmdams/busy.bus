<h1>Busy Bus Application</h1>

<h4>Application to give commuters more predictability in their transit.  Includes bus schedules, locations, and ETA, so commuters can plan their routes.  Developed with Figma, Sketch, CSS, HTML.</h4>

The goal of this project is to solve the problem of too many crowds at specific bus stops, to help commuters know when the next bus is and what the expected wait times are so that they can plan their commute in the best way.  The idea for this Busy Bus application came in 5 parts.

First, with the goal in mind, I identified with my user survey, that people are also looking for more predictability in their transit and less people in their public transportation uses.  Some don’t use public transportation because of its inconvenience and the undesirable experience of it.  It is clear that through a better system, it can be more convenient and nicer experience for commuters.

I compared two of the biggest competitors in the market: GoogleMaps and City Mappers.  Both have a lot of power, but there are a few weaknesses.  This is where I see an open market for Busy Bus.  GoogleMaps is the leader in current trends, but the current public transportation system is outdated.  City Mappers is also creating a platform to help users find their preferred public transportation route, but they are pushing public transportation forward by integrating a small bus service.  Busy bus gives commuters real time information for their bus services, locations, and estimated time of arrival so they can plan their commute with the least amount of confusion and wait time.  Busy Bus can also take this idea further in the future and create a new line of buses connected to the app and the Busy Bus vision.  The buses could have less people, alternative pick up points, wifi and technology on the buses, real life bus tracking, and membership benefits. 

While the focus of this initial app is to show routes, destinations, maps and estimated times of arrivals (in accordance with the initial goal) – Busy Bus has the ability to expand very much in the future.  If our commuters want a more convenient and nicer experience, it is likely that the city bus system could solve this problem through privatizing a bus company service.  Instead of paying a fare for each ride, users have a subscription plan so they don’t have to bother with bus meters or paying.  They scan their membership id.  Inside the membership there are many perks to make the bus ride more enjoyable.  You have the ability to rate your driver, save destination, follow the route and bus in real time through the app, see in real time the ETAs or other traffic issues.  A social media app could be integrated as well.  It would be possible to have different levels of membership, especially if the system grew in size and more needs were identified.  

After identifying the basic needs for the application, I went through user stories to determine what things needed to be included on the prototype of the app.  The basis was for the commuter to enter origins, destinations, see directions, find bus routes, and know the time of arrivals on the app.  Finding schedules and routes closest to the commuter were also identified as important, as well as customizing favorite destinations connected to a user account.

When creating my prototype, I made three panels.  One of the screens would show where a real time map of the buses and the commuter, ETAs, where to wait for the buses, and how to determine your best route.  The next screen would show more detailed information about the buses like when they arrive, their exact route and all the stops on the route, so commuters could follow along with the stops or find more information.  The third was a more personalized panel that has your favorite destinations or saved destinations and other possible user services.

When I surveyed my prototype, users were able to navigate intuitively because of its similarity to other service apps and its use of commonly recognized action buttons.  It gives the ability to do the basic necessities of the app and solve the problems that need to be solved.  There was some confusion as the survey participants tested the prototype, therefore, I will make some changes as the application moves forward. 

Next steps for the prototype include:
Keeping the amount for information for the times and buses to a minimum and make it clear and easy to understand – keeping a focus on the ETAs.  Change the second screen to be more informative.  Take away the emphasis on the live bus screens and keep it simple and understandable.  I will use a route map photo and a simple timetable. Change around the last screen and turn it into an homepage for the app.  Take away the user account emphasis.  Move favorites to the first screen with the direction and maps.
